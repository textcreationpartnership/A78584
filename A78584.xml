            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Will firſt preſent him in Groſſe, and then give you him in his Anatomy: but I am afraid he will ſtink before I have read through every part of him.

From <hi>Saxony</hi> the Vermin crept to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where that Bears Whelp was licked by Sodomitical <hi>Iohn</hi> into Deformity, and if you will not believe my Geography that <hi>Sodom</hi> ſtood where now <hi>Geneva</hi> doth when <hi>Calvin</hi> lived there, I have his Back, though not his Hand, to ſhew for it, where the <hi>Oxford</hi> Doctor may read the meaning of that hard word <gap reason="foreign">

He is one of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Lean Kine, that ſignifies no leſſe than Famine and Death: He was ſent amongſt us as a plague; and we ſwarm no leſſe with them, than <hi>Egypt</hi> did with Frogs and Flyes.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168895:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 15 -->Child of new light, who thinks forſooth that the Day breaks firſt in at his window; but let me tell you, he that follows his Dark Lanthorn, had need to call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud hang our your Lights. But becauſe the man is apt to take pet, I will grant him ſome reſemblance to that Courtly Creature, and call him an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> that leads the paſſenger into Bogs and Waters; a piece of Rotten Wood, or a Glittering Gloworm, a meer <hi>Quaſi,</hi> and no more. Fewer Taylors goe to the making of a Man, than of theſe Inches of Theologues to the conſtitution of a Divine, and yet they will ſay you a Grace of an Ell long, <hi>London</hi> meaſure. He is juſt as much a Parſon, as I in my black Coat, or you in your Gray, for he wears both Diſguiſes. Let the Stature of his Body be what it will, you muſt take the dimenſion of his Knowledge, not as we do thoſe Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of old in Learning, by the Cubit, but as we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the poor Pigmyes of theſe times, by the Span. Neither indeed can we expect that he ſhould be ſtrong timber for the edifying of Gods Temple, who was plucked up as ſoon as he was planted in the Nurſery of the Academy. A Senior he is the firſt day of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculation, and thinks himſelf a Sophy before he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives to a Sophiſter. This fond conceit of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, makes him like a careleſſe Child, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Lap of his Mother, before he is ſo much a ſubſtantive as to ſtand by himſelf; He thinks not that that largeneſſe of his Head, is nothing but the Rickets, a Diſeaſe, and not Diſcipline, he would not elſe ſure ſet up the Trade of Preaching, before he had ſerved out his apprentiſhip in the Univerſity. We muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him then fluttering in his flying Coat, and Pearching in the Puipit, where we ſhall find him a pretty Parrot that hath juſt learned to ſpeak; His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency lyes in praying <hi>ex tempore,</hi> that is, out of all

O God!</hi> His Sermon (that we may give it its due) is a Noted one, or a Sermon of Notes taken up in Groſſe at the Univerſity, or ſome Forein Congregation, and disburſt in the Retayl to his own Pariſhioners. I grant he hath taken ſome pains in wire-drawing it into words at length, which he before penned in Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nography or ſhort hand, whence we may collect, That our Learned Sir <hi>John</hi> can Write and Read, and able if need requires to make uſe of the <hi>Benefit of the Clergy.</hi> Trace him in his Doctrines, and you ſhall find him to tread very much awry. He is an abſolute man for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Reprobation, and damneth you and me before we were born, or were ſo much as capable of doing God or man the leaſt injury: I ſay, by Gods revealed will I may be ſaved, if I do as God commands me; and he ſays by Gods ſecret will I am damned, thus he makes God one of his own Antipodes to tread contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to himſelf, and though his Motto is <hi>ſemper idem,</hi> he would have him to be <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to ſpeak one thing and to mean another, as if he was one of Gods privy Council, or as if he and not <hi>St. Peter</hi> kept the Keys of Heaven. And if they make ſo bold with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no wonder then if they invade the Liberties of his Vicegerents, and maintain that a Subject may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Laws to his Prince, and depoſe him, if he does not obſerve them: this was the Dagger which ſtabbed ſo many of the Scotiſh Kings, and this the Axe which ſtruck off the Head of Ours, and for our late civil diſſentions, thank <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox,</hi> they led up the Van in the Villany, and our Presbyter brought

               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->up the Rear. He hates with a perfect hatred the Engliſh Prelates, with all their Hierarchy, and counts his Ordination as good as theirs. He is a meer Sloven in his Devotion, and would have no heads bare in the Church, but what are ſo in reverence to his own little Grace, no knee to be bowed except it be to ask him forgiveneſſe. The ſight of a Picture he can by no means endure, when his ſelf is no more but the Picture of a Preacher. He can't away with the ſuperſtition of the Holy Font, becauſe it can't walk and wait upon his idleneſſe to the Pew door, but will celebrate the Sacrament of Baptiſm in the common Baſon he laſt waſhed his dirty hands and face in.</p>
            <p>If you ſaw his Congregation receiving the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body and Blood of our bleſſed Saviour, you would think the good People were ſet down to make a ſober meal of it, to refreſh their hungry Bodies, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their Souls, nor dares he Holy-man admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter thoſe heavenly Viands, without a ſevere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into the lives of the Communicants; and though God of his mercy hath invited all, yet none muſt be admitted, but thoſe to whom the Comptroller of Gods Houſe doth pleaſe to give a Ticket, as if he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, who ſo much hates the Catholick Doctrine, had a months mind to become their Confeſſor, when indeed 'tis only to pick a hole in his Neighbours Coat, to diſcover his nakedneſſe, that ſo lying but at open-ward he may wound him at his pleaſure. For my part, if he ſhould tell me I had not my wedding Garment on, and ſo not fit to come to the marriage Supper, I would be ſo bold as to ask him, <hi>Friend how cam'ſt thou hither?</hi> He tells the ſilly people, he is Gods Angel, and Embaſſadour, and ſhews them Scripture for it, he comes to acquaint them with the mind of God, and that they ought to reverence the Meſſenger for

What the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was, he would be, &amp; what <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were in the State, he is in the Church, impatient of either Superiour or Equal. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſome have called the Spouſe of Chriſt, he can give her no better appellation than the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Scarlet Whore, and one of them was witty and ſaid in the Pulpit, ſhe was a Whore that deſerved to be Carted, but the reaſon of this Obloquy I can't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, except it be this, that he is aſhamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he hath his Chriſtianity from Her, and that he had rather borrow his Religion from <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin, Dod,</hi> and <hi>Cleaver,</hi> than <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Biſhop; thus Ingratitude will make one ingredient in the compoſition of our <hi>Hotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot Preſbyter,</hi> in that he will not pay thoſe thanks and obedience that is due to the Mother-Church, but Nick-name her too, wherein he hath unworthy <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> in imitation, who nick-named reverend <hi>Chriſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> by the name of <hi>Cheſippus,</hi> not withſtanding he was his Maſter, and taught him his firſt Leſſon. But leſt I ſhould like him in his Sermon prove ſom-what long-winded, I will leave the Divine (for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſmell ſomwhat ſtrong, though he be but a weak one,) and take a ſhort ſurvey of the man and his manners: You ſhall find nothing about him to prove that he is deſcended of humane Race, but his hands, and head, his face, and feer, all which the very <hi>Ape</hi> and <hi>Drill</hi> can plead for their humanity: for take him as a neighbour, and he is a peſtilent peeviſh Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that ſhall ſue you for a <hi>Tyth-Pig,</hi> you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

He knows the Returns, and Eſſoin days, as well as he knows the Sunday, and is ſorry that that is not <hi>dies Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridicus</hi> too; If he chance to prove Victor, down he poſts upon his pittiful Palfray with his <hi>Io Triumphe</hi> in his mouth, proclaims to every one he meets the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Cauſe, and continues his Conqueſt by inſultation.
